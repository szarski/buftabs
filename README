 Introduction
 ------------

 This is a simple script that shows a tabs-like list of buffers in the bottom
 of the window. The biggest advantage of this script over various others is
 that it does not take any lines away from your terminal, leaving more space
 for the document you're editing. The tabs are only visible when you need
 them - when you are switchin between buffers.

 Usage
 -----
 
 This script draws buffer tabs on vim startup, when a new buffer is created
 and when switching between buffers.

 It might be handy to create a few maps for easy switching of buffers in your
 .vimrc file. For example, using F1 and F2 keys:

   noremap <f1> :bprev<CR> 
   noremap <f2> :bnext<CR>

 or using control-left and control-right keys:

   :noremap <C-left> :bprev<CR>
   :noremap <C-right> :bnext<CR>


 The following extra configuration variables are availabe:
 
 * g:buftabs_only_basename

   Define this variable to make buftabs only print the filename of each buffer,
   omitting the preceding directory name. Add to your .vimrc:

   :let g:buftabs_only_basename=1


 * g:buftabs_in_statusline

   Define this variable to make the plugin show the buftabs in the statusline
   instead of the command line. It is a good idea to configure vim to show
   the statusline as well when only one window is open. Add to your .vimrc:

   set laststatus=2
   :let g:buftabs_in_statusline=1
    
   By default buftabs will take up the whole of the left-aligned section of
   your statusline. You can alternatively specify precisely where it goes
   using %{buftabs#statusline()} e.g.:

   set statusline=%=buffers:\ %{buftabs#statusline()}


 * g:buftabs_active_highlight_group
 * g:buftabs_inactive_highlight_group

   The name of a highlight group (:help highligh-groups) which is used to
   show the name of the current active buffer and of all other inactive
   buffers. If these variables are not defined, no highlighting is used.
   (Highlighting is only functional when g:buftabs_in_statusline is enabled)

   :let g:buftabs_active_highlight_group="Visual"


 * g:buftabs_marker_start    [
 * g:buftabs_marker_end      ]
 * g:buftabs_separator       -
 * g:buftabs_marker_modified !

   These strings are drawn around each tab as separators, the 'marker_modified' 
   symbol is used to denote a modified (unsaved) buffer.

   :let g:buftabs_separator = "."  
   :let g:buftabs_marker_start = "("
   :let g:buftabs_marker_end = ")"
   :let g:buftabs_marker_modified = "*"
